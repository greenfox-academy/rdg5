What is the difference between id and class in CSS? [2p]

Despite the fact that both id and class are considered 'Hooks', there is some basic difference
between them. Namely that while ID's are UNIQUE, Classes are not. What this means is that
every element can only have one ID.
Classes on the other hand can be used on multiple elements and you also have the possibility
to use multiple classes on the same element.
Another interesting aspect is that while classes have no special function in the browser, ID's
have greater role, namely that browsers can identify content by their ID, such as the main-content,
the header, or a sidebar.
